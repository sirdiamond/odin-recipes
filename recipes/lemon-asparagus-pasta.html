    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 large lemon, zested and juiced</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Â½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>freshly cracked black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step-By-Step</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, for about 8 minutes. Penne will still be slightly firm. </li>
        <li>Stir asparagus into the pot with the boiling penne pasta and bring back to a boil; cook until pasta is tender and asparagus is softened but still bright green, about 3 more minutes. Drain pasta and asparagus. </li>
        <li>Place penne and asparagus into a large bowl; lightly stir in lemon zest, lemon juice, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, salt, and black pepper until thoroughly combined. </li>

    </ol>
